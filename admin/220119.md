Meeting Notes
----------------

* Types of app collusion
  - One author 2 apps
  - Accidental opening of one app to another
* Android apps get the internet permission for free.
  - Why bother with app collusion?
  - Why would malware go through the trouble of multiple apps to get data?
  - Ask for the permission, not install additional apps
* Side-channels to think about:
  - Modulating the volume of a device requires no permissions, could data be sent?
  - Prolog work seemed obvious, what was it doing?
* Jorden mentioned modified versions of Android, e.g., TaintDroid
  - What are some of the advantages / disadvantages?
  - Why not implemented in the real world?
