  abstract  = {Application collusion is an emerging threat to Android based devices. In app collusion, two or more apps collude in some manner to perform a malicious action that they are unable to do independently. Detection of colluding apps is a challenging task. Existing commercial malware detection systems analyse each app separately, hence fail to detect any joint malicious action performed by multiple apps through collusion. In this paper, we discuss the current state of research on app collusion and open challenges to the detection of colluding apps. We compare existing approaches and present an integrated approach to effectively detect app collusion.},

  abstract  = {Mobile devices pose a particular security risk because they hold personal details and have capabilities potentially exploitable for eavesdropping. The Android operating system is designed with a number of built-in security features such as application sandboxing and permission-based access control. Unfortunately, these restrictions can be bypassed, without the user noticing, by colluding apps whose combined permissions allow them to carry out attacks that neither app is able to execute by itself. In this paper, we develop a software model-checking approach within the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}K{\}}{\$}{\$}Kframework that is capable to detect collusion. This involves giving an abstract, formal semantics to Android applications and proving that the applied abstraction principles lead to a finite state space.},

  abstract       = {Android has become the most popular mobile platform, and a hot target for malware developers. At the same time, researchers have come up with numerous ways to deal with malware. Among them, machine learning based methods are quite effective in Android malware detection, the accuracy of which can be as high as 98%. Thus, malware developers have the incentives to develop more advanced malware to evade detection. This paper presents an adversary attack scenario (Collusion Attack) that will compromise current machine learning based malware detection methods, especially Support Vector Machines (SVM). The malware developers can perform this attack easily by splitting malicious payload into two or more apps. Meanwhile, attackers may hide their malicious behavior by using advanced techniques (Evasion Attack), such as obfuscation, etc. According to our simulation, 87.4% of apps can evade Linear SVM by Collusion Attack. When performing Collusion and Evasion Attack simultaneously, the evasion rate can reach 100% at a low cost. Thus, we proposed a method to deal with this issue. This approach, realized in a tool, called ColluDroid, can identify the collusion apps by analyzing the communication between apps. In addition, it can integrate secure learning methods (e.g., Sec-SVM) to fight against Evasion Attack. The evaluation results show that ColluDroid is effective in finding out the collusion apps and ColluDroid-Sec-SVM has the best performance in the presence of both Collusion and Evasion Attack.},

  abstract  = {Android has become the most popular platform for mobile devices, and also it has become a popular target for malware developers. At the same time, researchers have proposed a large number of methods, both static and dynamic analysis methods, to fight against malwares. Among these, Machine learning based methods are quite effective in Android malware detection, the accuracy of which can be up to 98{\%}. Thus, malware developers have the incentives to develop more advanced malwares to evade detection. This paper presents an adversary attack pattern that will compromise current machine learning based malware detection methods. The malware developers can perform this attack easily by splitting malicious payload into two or more apps. The split apps will all be classified as benign by current methods. Thus, we proposed a method to deal with this issue. This approach, realized in a tool, called ColluDroid, can identify the collusion apps by analyzing the communication between apps. The evaluation results show that ColluDroid is effective in finding out the collusion apps. Also, we showed that it's easy to split an app to evade detection. According to our split simulation, the evasion rate is 78{\%}, when split into two apps; while the evasion rate comes to 94.8{\%}, when split into three apps.},
