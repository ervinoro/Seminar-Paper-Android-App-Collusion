## Abstract

As people increasingly rely on their smartphones, both the number and
complexity of malware attacks against Android are growing. While
defending Android is an active area of research, a number of threats,
e.g., app collusion, still cannot be reliably detected nor defended
against. App collusion is a secret collaboration between apps with
malicious intentions. This report surveyes state-of-the-art literature
discussing methods that can be used for collusion on Android, and known
examples of such collusion. It also reviewes existing approaches to app
collusion detection, and their limitations. Existing literature has
significant shortcomings, such as outdated or uncredible claims and
inconsistent definitions. Further research is required to develop
feasible protections against Android app collusion, and the unified
definition and criteria proposed in this report could be developed into
a common framework for assisting the research community in achieveving
that goal.
